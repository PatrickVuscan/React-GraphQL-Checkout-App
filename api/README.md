# Facile-Checkout-API

This is the API for facileCheckout. It is built using GraphQL!

## Deployment

For the deployment docker was used to package the nodejs app for the API logic. The container was then deployed to GCP.

For the deployment of the database [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used in order to take advantage of their free-tier hobbiest Postgress database.

Overall, getting the nodejs API to work with docker was more challenging than we first had imagined given that there were a few minor details that were needed be figured out. 



## In Conclusion

This was a great experience! - 2020/10/5 [@mhd53][https://github.com/mhd53]
